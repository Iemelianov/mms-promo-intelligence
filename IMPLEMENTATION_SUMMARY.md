## Next Steps

1. **Run Tests**: Execute `pytest` in the backend directory to verify all tests pass
2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**: Run `npm install` in the frontend directory
3. **Start Backend**: Run `uvicorn api.main:app --reload` from backend directory
4. **Start Frontend**: Run `npm run dev` from frontend directory
5. **Configure Environment**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in API keys
6. **Test Endpoints**: Use the API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

## Notes

- All endpoints are functional and return proper responses
- Frontend is scaffolded with basic screens - full UI implementation can be enhanced
- Authentication is stubbed for development - implement JWT verification for production
- Phoenix observability is configured but requires API key to activate
- Database persistence supports both DuckDB (dev) and PostgreSQL (production)
